# Udacitiy - Adnroid Developer Fast Track - Project 1

## Project Overview
Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1. In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

Requirements:

Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
original title
movie poster image thumbnail
A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
user rating (called vote_average in the api)
release date

## Instructions

Clone the project and open it in Android studio

Change the API key used to access www.themoviedb.org by opening NetworkUtils class and replace the public static variable API_KEY with yours.
